# GCode Batcher

A basic CLI tool for taking a Marlin CNC-targeted gcode file and multiplying the toolpaths along the XY plane to create a custom batch that consolidates tool changes for optimal "large-run" milling.

Warning: This may not work for you. While parsing, I am looking for specific indicators generated by custom Fusion 360 post processing for the Mostly-3d-printed CNC (https://vicious1.com).
